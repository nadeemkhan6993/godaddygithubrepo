# React + Vite

This project is created with JavaScript Library React, using the bundler Vite.

Steps to run the code, 

1. Open command prompt at the location of the code
2. run 'npm install' //this command will install all the depandancies required for the project.
3. run "npm run dev" //this command will start the dev server,

Now hit the URL 'http://localhost:5173/' in browser to visualize the UI.




Something about the project: 
    - Language : JavaScript, HTML/CSS
    - APi integration through axios.
    - React Bootstrap for Styling
    - contex API is used for managing state.
    - react-router-dom is used for routing
    - Hooks used in this project : useState, useContex, useEffect
    - On landing page you can see the GoDaddy gihub repository list, you can click on the button to get the details, for that I have used routing on the basis of ID and it will take you to the new page where the details of the selected repository is visible. There is one link provided to visit the github page of that repository and it will open in other tab of the browser.



Improvement Scope :
    - HTML/CSS can be improved
    - Optimization should be done for the very large dataset
